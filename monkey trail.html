            <h3>Monkey Trail</h3>
            <p>
The great interest in the small transition Monkey trail is an accidental discovery during my Ao Nang play. The distance is very short and doesn't take much time, so it can be used as a small transition between the big attractions, and it has a special flavor. It is an attraction open to the public. Play guide Monkey trail is a somewhat steep trail, if you have bad legs, it is not necessary to walk. The stairs are short, but you can see the beautiful surroundings. I am a relatively timid person who dare not climb too steep stairs. It's okay to walk slowly with my family. It is a challenge</p>
